## ðŸ§¬ I. Central Process of DNA Information Translation: From Sequence to Function Transfer Pathway

### Core Chain (Information Flow):

```
DNA (sequence + epigenetic marks)
   â†“ (transcription initiation and regulation)
Precursor mRNA (regulation, splicing)
   â†“ (maturation and export)
Mature mRNA (stability, localization)
   â†“ (translation and regulation)
Proteins (active complexes, regulatory circuits)
   â†“
Cellular behavior & phenotype
```

Each step involves specific molecular mechanisms and corresponding experimental recording methods.

## ðŸ§ª II. Correspondence Between Key Molecules and Experimental Methods

| Biological Level | Core Molecular Behavior | Representative Data Types | What the Data Represents |
|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| **DNA Sequence** | Gene location, promoters, enhancers, etc. | Gene annotation (RefSeq, Ensembl) | Information template |
| **Epigenetic Modifications** | DNA methylation, histone modifications | **Bisulfite-seq**, **ChIP-seq(H3K27ac, H3K4me3)** | Control gene readability |
| **Transcription Factor Binding** | TF-DNA specific binding | **ChIP-seq (TFs)** | Activate or repress transcription |
| **RNA Polymerase Behavior** | Initiation, pausing, elongation, termination | **ChIP-seq(Pol II)**, **NET-seq**, **PRO-seq**, **GRO-seq** | Real-time recording of transcriptional state |
| **RNA Generation** | Transcription product formation | **RNA-seq**, **CAGE** | Actual expression levels and splicing status |
| **RNA Stability and Translation Efficiency** | 3'UTR regulation, nuclear export, translation rate | **Ribo-seq**, **mRNA half-life** | Determine expression output efficiency |

## ðŸ§¬ III. Multi-level Behavioral Network Centered on RNA Polymerase II

RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) is the most critical executor in DNA transcription, whose behavior connects epigenetic regulation and expression output. Below is the correspondence between its behavior and different data:

| Pol II Behavior | Data Type | Description |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Recruitment to promoter** | ChIP-seq (Pol II + H3K4me3) | Identify gene initiation state |
| **Transcription initiation** | GRO-seq, PRO-seq | Detect active promoters, short transcripts |
| **Pausing (promoter-proximal pausing)** | NET-seq, PRO-seq | Assess transcriptional regulatory strength |
| **Elongation into gene body** | ChIP-seq (Pol II S2P), GRO-seq | Determine full-length mRNA generation |
| **Termination and release** | PolyA-seq, CAGE | Determine transcription termination sites |

These processes are subject to multiple regulations from:
- Epigenetic marks (such as H3K27ac) activating enhancers
- TF and Pol II interactions
- Chromatin conformation (such as looping) regulation

## ðŸ”„ IV. Integrated Understanding Model from "Sequence to Behavior"

An integrated perspective is as follows:

```
â–¶ DNA Sequence
  â”œâ”€ Epigenetic modifications (ChIP-seq, BS-seq)
  â”œâ”€ TF binding sites (ChIP-seq)
  â””â”€ Promoters/enhancers (ATAC-seq, DNase-seq)

â–¶ Transcriptional Behavior
  â”œâ”€ Polymerase tracks (NET-seq, GRO-seq)
  â”œâ”€ Actual expression (RNA-seq)
  â””â”€ Splicing and alternative splicing (Long-read RNA-seq)

â–¶ Post-transcriptional Regulation
  â”œâ”€ Translation efficiency (Ribo-seq)
  â”œâ”€ RNA stability (half-life assay)
  â””â”€ mRNA localization (FISH, subcellular fractionation)

â–¶ Protein Behavior
  â”œâ”€ Expression levels (MS-based proteomics)
  â”œâ”€ Complex formation (CORUM)
  â””â”€ Functional pathways (Reactome, KEGG)

â–¶ Network Control
  â”œâ”€ Gene regulatory networks (TF-target motifs)
  â””â”€ Feedback and topology (Hi-C, CRISPR perturbation)
```

This model allows you to start from "a DNA fragment" and track its fate in the cell until it becomes part of a molecular network that affects physiological behavior.

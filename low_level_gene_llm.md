# Low-Level Gene LLMs: From DNA Sequence to mRNA Processes

## Overview

This document organizes database resources for recording and interpreting DNA transcriptase (especially RNA polymerase) behavior, as well as related low-level gene language model technologies.

## üî¨ I. Database Resources Related to RNA Polymerase Transcriptional Behavior

### 1. **ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements)**
- **Website**: https://www.encodeproject.org/
- **Content**: Contains large-scale ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and GRO-seq data that can be used to analyze RNA polymerase binding and transcriptional activity across the genome
- **Advantages**: Rich data variety, including different cell lines and experimental conditions, suitable for analyzing transcription initiation, pausing, elongation, and other behaviors

### 2. **GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus)**
- **Website**: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/
- **Content**: NCBI's gene expression and functional genomics data repository. Contains extensive ChIP-seq and NET-seq data for RNA polymerase II and III
- **Advantages**: Can search keywords like "RNA Polymerase II ChIP-seq" or "PRO-seq" to find multiple high-quality experimental datasets

### 3. **Roadmap Epigenomics Project**
- **Website**: http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/
- **Content**: Provides epigenetic and transcriptional regulation-related data, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, RNA polymerase localization, etc.
- **Application**: If you want to explain transcriptase behavior from chromatin state, it provides valuable auxiliary data

### 4. **PaxDb / CORUM / Reactome**
- Although they don't directly provide RNA polymerase II dynamic trajectories, these databases can supplement information on **protein expression**, **complex composition**, **transcriptional regulatory pathways**, etc.

## üß™ II. Experimental Techniques and Data Types Focused on Recording RNA Polymerase Behavior

To faithfully "record RNA polymerase behavior," the following high-throughput or single-molecule experimental methods should be prioritized:

### 1. **NET-seq (Native Elongating Transcript sequencing)**
- **Recorded Content**: Base-precise RNA polymerase active sites; can be used to detect transcriptional pausing and termination
- **Available Databases**: Extensive NET-seq datasets in GEO (such as GSE60456)

### 2. **PRO-seq (Precision Run-On sequencing)**
- **Recorded Content**: Similar to NET-seq, but can capture precise positions of actively transcribing RNA polymerase
- **Advantages**: Can reflect transcriptional dynamic changes under different regulatory conditions

### 3. **GRO-seq (Global Run-On sequencing)**
- **Purpose**: Study genome-wide transcription initiation, pausing, and elongation
- **Suitable for Analysis**: Global transcriptional activity profiles

### 4. **ChIP-seq (targeting RNA Polymerase II)**
- **Purpose**: Shows which regions RNA polymerase binds to DNA
- **Limitations**: Cannot precisely distinguish initiation/elongation states, but can be analyzed in combination with other methods

## üß† III. How to "Interpret" These Behavioral Data to Understand DNA

If the goal is to **infer or explain DNA function through transcriptase behavior**, the following are common research approaches:

| Data Type | Interpretable Behavior | Inferred DNA Function |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| NET-seq / PRO-seq | Pausing, backtracking, progression, termination | Fine structure of regulatory regions, promoter efficiency |
| ChIP-seq | Binding density and distribution | Active gene regions, silent regions, enhancer positions |
| GRO-seq | Genome-wide transcriptional trends | Tissue/condition-specific expression patterns |
| Combined epigenomic data | Regulatory and expression coordination | Localization of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms |

You can use these data for further exploration in frameworks such as **machine learning, sequence modeling, or kinetic modeling**, for example:

- **Predicting transcription start sites**
- **Building DNA-RNA polymerase interaction models**
- **Revealing functions of non-coding DNA regions**

## üì¶ IV. Recommended Getting Started Steps

1. Search for keywords in GEO:
   ```
   RNA polymerase II NET-seq Homo sapiens
   RNA polymerase PRO-seq mouse
   ```

2. Download `.bigWig` or `.bam` format track files, using:
   - IGV (visualization tool)
   - `deepTools` (data processing)
   - `pyBigWig` (Python reading)

3. Integrate sequences and tracks, train a predictive model (such as CNN, Transformer) to infer DNA function or regulatory significance from transcriptional behavior

## üß¨ V. GeneLM Low-Level Model Type Definition

According to the original answer, we can classify GeneLM (language models for interpreting or predicting gene expression behavior) as:

**GeneLM: A model that maps genomic sequences or trajectory information to structured predictions or natural language explanations.**

### GeneLM Classification:

| GeneLM Type | Input | Output | Example Models |
|-------------|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Sequence ‚Üí Function Prediction** | DNA sequence (+context) | ChIP-seq / RNA-seq tracks, etc. | Enformer, Basenji2 |
| **Structure ‚Üí Expression Behavior Interpretation** | Epigenomic data (such as Pol II binding maps) | Gene expression behavior explanations | scGPT, GenoBERT |
| **Knowledge ‚Üí Language Description** | gene symbol / genomic position | Natural language functional explanations | BioGPT, GeneTuring, GeneFormer |

## üß† VI. Representative Low-Level GeneLM Examples

### Example 1: **Enformer (Google DeepMind)**

A model that uses Transformer architecture to **predict multiple tracks (such as RNA expression, ChIP-seq)** from DNA sequences.

#### Input:
```text
ATCGCGATCGTAGCTAGTCA... (containing upstream and downstream sequences of target gene)
```

#### Output:
A vector prediction matrix, such as:
```json
{
  "Pol2_binding_track": [0.02, 0.13, 0.85, 0.77, ...],
  "RNA_expression_signal": [0.01, 0.05, 0.21, 0.99, ...],
  "H3K27ac_signal": [...],
  ...
}
```

#### Application Scenarios:
- **Predicting whether mutations affect transcriptional regulation** (such as eQTL)
- **Revealing enhancer-promoter interactions**

> üìå **Not natural language output**, but results can be visualized in UCSC browser for interpretation.

### Example 2: **NVIDIA's scGPT**

A large model for **single-cell transcriptomic language modeling**, focusing on "gene expression pattern" modeling and interpretation.

#### Input:
```json
{
  "cell_type": "Hepatocyte",
  "gene_context": ["TP53", "BRCA1", "HNF4A"],
  "condition": "oxidative stress"
}
```

#### Output:
```json
{
  "predicted_expression": {
    "TP53": 0.93,
    "BRCA1": 0.11,
    "HNF4A": 0.88
  },
  "latent_feature_vector": [...]
}
```

> scGPT is a typical example of GeneLM, **treating gene expression as "language tokens"** for contextual modeling.
